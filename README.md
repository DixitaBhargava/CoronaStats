# CoronaStats
CoronaStats is an application made using Swift UI, which gets the user the live data about the world using APIs from 
rapidapi.com. It shows us the Confirmed, Critical and Recovered cases in the whole world and also shows us the amount 
of deaths that have taken place. It also shows us the death and recovery percentages. We can have access to the data
using the country name as well. On selecting any particular country you can see the active cases, confirmed, new cases, 
recovered, critical, deaths, new deaths, total tests done in that country, fatality rate and recovered rate . 
The app provides us with a MapView as well, through which you can can see the country name, number of confirmed cases 
and deaths. It is also dark mode enabled. It is compatible with Mac & iOS.
